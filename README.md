# i_am_rich

A first-timer flutter app developed under a course project by Angela Yu  @londonappbrewery

## About App
i_am_rich app tries to replicate a classic app that was once present on apple app store wherein the app simply has a single image and no functionality whatsoever. 

Looks silly but the developer back then had priced it so high that it was only brought by super wealthy and thus had become a symbol of wealth(as if a $200 iPhone couldn't make that point enough. ;))
